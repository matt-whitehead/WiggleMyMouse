# WiggleMyMouse

## Introduction
This is a simple application that I made as my first attempt at Mac App development in Swift! It is a simple utility that wiggles the mouse every 1-5 minutes to keep your computer awake. It has the added benefit of preventing you from being marked "Idle" or "Away" in any chat apps that you are using.

Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are appreciated :)

## Installation
1. Simply download WiggleMyMouse.app 
2. You're done! You can move it to the /Applications folder if you wish, but it isn't necessary. 

## Usage 
1. Launch the application
2. Select the number of minutes between mouse wiggles using the slider
3. Click "Start"
4. At any time you may click "Stop" to cease wiggling the mouse, or you can just quit the application.
